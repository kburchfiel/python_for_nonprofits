# Python for Nonprofits

In this project, I will aim to show how nonprofits can use Python to advance their missions. I hope to add a number of projects to this series as time allows.

## [Part 1: Sharing Database Data](https://github.com/kburchfiel/python_for_nonprofits/tree/main/part_1) (Complete)

Part 1 demonstrates how to use Python to read data from a database, then export that data to a Google Sheets workbook. This approach can be a great way to make the contents of a database accessible to individuals who don't have a background in SQL.

I also created [a video to accompany this project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vW_c_1ngxQ). This video demonstrates how to create a new Google Cloud project; initialize a service account; create and download a service account key; authorize the service account to update a Google Sheets workbook; and, finally, update that workbook with Google Sheets.
