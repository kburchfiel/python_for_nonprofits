    "# Python for Nonprofits Part 1: Sharing Database Data Via Google Sheets\n",
    "\n",

    "(Note: This project was based on my [Google Sheets Database Connections](https://github.com/kburchfiel/google_sheets_database_connections) Python project.)\n",
    "\n",
    "I also created a video walkthrough of this project that shows how to complete the Google Cloud prerequisites described below. You can find that video [on my YouTube channel.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vW_c_1ngxQ)"

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates how to use Python to read data from a database, then export that data to a Google Sheets document. This approach can be a great way to make the contents of a database accessible to individuals who don't have a background in SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to update this Google Sheets document with the latest copy of your data on a regular basis, you can export this script to a Python file, then have your operating system run that task each day, hour, etc. using a tool like cron or Task Scheduler. (If you're on Windows, you can use the run_sharing_database_data_py.bat as a starting point for a .bat file that you could feed into Task Scheduler to automatically run this script; you'd just need to replace the file path shown in the first line with your own path.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will import an entire table from a local SQLite database, then export an unmodified copy of that table to Google Sheets. The 'Spreadsheet Ops' section of Python for Nonprofits demonstrates how Python's pandas library can be used to reformat and analyze data."

    "# Prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can apply this code to your own projects (or get it to run locally on your own computer), you'll need to perform some setup tasks. Many of these tasks are based on the ['For Bots: Using Service Account'](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/oauth2.html#service-account) section of gspread's documentation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1:\n",
    "Open a Google Cloud Platform project. I used the Google Cloud Console to accomplish this step. For instructions, go to https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#console. \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: You may incur expenses when using the Google Cloud platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2:\n",
    "Enable the Google Sheets API for your project. To do so, enter 'Sheets API' within the search box near the top of the Google Cloud Platform window. Click on the 'Google Sheets API' result and then select the blue 'Enable' button. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3:\n",
    "Create a Google service account. You can do so by following the steps shown in Google's [Create service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create#iam-service-accounts-create-console) documentation page. (Although this page instructs you to \"enable the IAM API,\" I didn't need to do so in order for the following steps to work, but it's possible that this API had been enabled beforehand for my Cloud Console project.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4:\n",
    "Create a key in JSON format for your new service account, then download it to your computer (as a .json file) and store it in a safe location. See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys \n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5:\n",
    "Grant this service account Editor access to the Google Sheet to which you will need to connect. You can grant it access by clicking the 'Share' button within the presentation and then entering the service account's email address within the box that appears. This email address can be found within the 'Service account details' page of your service account within the Google Cloud platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6: \n",
    "To get this notebook to run on your own computer, update the 'service_key_path' variable with the path to your own service account key, then update wb_id and ws_name with your own Google Sheets workbook."

    "(Note that you can pass the SQLAlchemy engine directly to the `con` argument of `read_sql`. This is made more explicit within the documentation for [DataFrame.to_sql](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable//reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_sql.html), which defines `con` as \"sqlalchemy.engine.(Engine or Connection) or sqlite3.Connection.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this functionality is also noted within the [read_sql](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_sql.html) documentation, which states that \"SQLAlchemy connectable\" is one of the options for `con`. A warning message within the [source code for pandasSQL_builder()] explains that \"pandas only supports SQLAlchemy connectable (engine/connection)),\" thus confirming that SQLAlchemy engines are one of the 'connectables' that can be entered within the `con` argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "I belabor this point simply because this approach saves you from having to enter a line like `connection = engine.connect()` [source](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/connections.html) before calling `read_sql`, and it's always nice to reduce the amount of code needed to accomplish a task!"
