# Python for Nonprofits

In this project, I will aim to show how nonprofits can use Python to manage, analyze, and visualize their data. I plan to add a number of projects to this series as time allows.

*Note*: This project is not meant to replace an introductory Python course or textbook. If you're new to Python, I suggest getting started with a resource like [Think Python, 3rd Edition](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-3rd-edition/). (I found the 2nd edition of this book to be very helpful in my own studies.)

# Contents

Here are the sections for which I've already completed a draft. (Note that these sections are labeled 'Part X', as I won't know exactly how to order them until I've completed all sections. However, I've listed them in the order that I suggest going through them.)

### [Spreadsheet Operations](https://github.com/kburchfiel/python_for_nonprofits/tree/main/part_x_spreadsheet_ops)

This section demonstrates how to use Python to perform many tasks for which you might normally use a spreadsheet editor. It also provides an introduction to Pandas, a powerful library for viewing and transforming data within Python.

### [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/kburchfiel/python_for_nonprofits/tree/main/part_x_data_cleaning)

In this section, you'll learn how to use Python to perform some basic data cleaning tasks. It also provides tips on handling duplicate entries and missing data.

### [Sharing Database Data](https://github.com/kburchfiel/python_for_nonprofits/tree/main/part_x_google_sheets_uploads)

This section demonstrates how to use Python to read data from a database, then export that data to a Google Sheets workbook. This approach can be a great way to make the contents of a database accessible to individuals who don't have a background in SQL.

I also created [a video to accompany this project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vW_c_1ngxQ). This video demonstrates how to create a new Google Cloud project; initialize a service account; create and download a service account key; authorize the service account to update a Google Sheets workbook; and, finally, update that workbook with Google Sheets.

### [Graphing *(still under construction)*](https://github.com/kburchfiel/python_for_nonprofits/tree/main/part_x_graphing)

Plotly is a powerful tool for creating both interactive and static charts. This section will demonstrate how to create bar, line, and scatter plots along with treemaps. 

### [Mapping](https://github.com/kburchfiel/python_for_nonprofits/tree/main/part_x_mapping) 

This section demonstrates how to use Folium to create interactive choropleth maps. I may expand this section in the future to include additional map types (such as maps of points and route maps).

## Supplemental Projects

The [db_generator](https://github.com/kburchfiel/python_for_nonprofits/tree/main/supplemental/db_generator) contains the code used to build the network_database.db file located within the [data](https://github.com/kburchfiel/python_for_nonprofits/tree/main/data) folder. I plan to use network_database.db in a number of projects, and I'll probably expand it with additional tables as needed.
